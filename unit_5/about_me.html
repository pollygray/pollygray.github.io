		<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
		<p>Hello! I am a freelance lighting technician and crew chief based in southern England. I work in many different roles in a team from ground rigging to system designing and project management. 
		I started in the entertainment industry 6 years ago when I was employed by TSL Lighting in Hove as a junior technician / warehouse manager. Prior to this I had worked for a local IT services company and as an electrician's mate. So lighting was a natural progression for me. I stayed at TSL for 3 years before leaving to travel around Australia for 8 months. While in Australia I carried on my work as a technician at the Sydney Exhibition Centre. I then returned to the UK to start my glorious career as a Freelancer.  
 
		Since then I have worked for a number of UK based organisations undertaking work both in the UK and in Europe. I have worked on many different event types including music touring, fashion, corporate and traditional theatre.
 
		I work in a mixture of different roles on site including lighting rigger tech, system tech, video/media server tech, LED wall tech, crew chief and project manager. </p>
